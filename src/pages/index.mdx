# OpenTDF 
## Overview

OpenTDF is designed to facilitate increased sensitive data sharing via secure, scalable, and persistent data protection. It leverages the Trusted Data Format (TDF), an open data encoding standard, to wrap sensitive data with attribute-based access controls, allowing individuals and organizations to enforce security policies throughout the dataâ€™s lifecycle, regardless of where the data travels.

## History and Current State

First released to the public in 2022 to meet the critical need for protecting data wherever it travels, a fundamental pillar of modern zero-trust architecture that existing solutions often fail to address. 

Sponsored by Virtru, OpenTDF serves as the foundational technology for the <a href="https://virtru.com/data-security-platform">Virtru Data Security Platform</a>, a platform that provides a comprehensive and adaptable foundation for data-centric security.
