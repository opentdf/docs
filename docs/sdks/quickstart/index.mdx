# SDK Quickstart

This guide shows you how to build a simple application using the OpenTDF SDKs to encrypt and decrypt data. You'll create a lightweight client that connects to your local OpenTDF platform and demonstrates the core SDK functionality.

:::tip Prerequisites
Complete the [Getting Started](/quickstart) guide first to set up your local OpenTDF platform. This quickstart assumes:
- Platform running at `https://platform.opentdf.local:8443`
- Keycloak running at `https://keycloak.opentdf.local:9443`
- Client credentials: `opentdf` / `secret`
:::

:::note Time Commitment
This quickstart takes **15-20 minutes** to complete.

## What You'll Build {#what-youll-build}

A simple application that:
1. Connects to your local OpenTDF platform
2. Authenticates using client credentials
3. Encrypts sensitive data into a TDF file
4. Decrypts the TDF file back to plaintext

## Choose Your SDK {#choose-your-sdk}

OpenTDF provides native SDKs in three languages. Choose your language to get started with complete, working examples:

## Key Concepts {#key-concepts}

### Client Credentials Authentication

All three SDKs use **client credentials** to authenticate with the platform. This is a machine-to-machine authentication flow suitable for:
- Backend services
- CLI tools
- Server-side applications
- Batch processing jobs

In production, you would create separate client IDs for each service with appropriate permissions.

### TDF Format

The SDKs create **TDF (Trusted Data Format)** files, which contain:
- **Encrypted payload**: Your data, encrypted with a symmetric key
- **Manifest**: Metadata including policy attributes and Key Access Server information
- **Policy**: Access control rules (which attributes are required to decrypt)

### Connection Security

:::warning Development Only - Language-Specific Settings
The SDK examples use different settings for local development with self-signed certificates:

**Go SDK**: `.WithInsecurePlaintextConn()`
**Java SDK**: `.useInsecurePlaintextConnection(true)`
**JavaScript SDK**: May need `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`

**Never use these settings in production.**

In production:
- Use HTTPS connections with valid TLS certificates
- Remove all insecure connection flags
- Configure proper certificate validation

## What's Next? {#whats-next}

Having issues? See the **[SDK Troubleshooting](/sdks/troubleshooting)** guide for solutions to common problems.



Now that you have basic SDK integration working, explore:

- **[Creating TDFs](/sdks/tdf)**: Learn about TDF options, attributes, and policies
- **[Managing Policy](/sdks/policy)**: Create and manage attributes programmatically
- **[Authorization](/sdks/authorization)**: Check entitlements and authorization decisions
- **[SDK Feature Matrix](/appendix/matrix#sdk)**: Compare features across SDKs
- **[Best Practices](/sdks/authorization#best-practices)**: Optimize for large-scale operations

### Real-World Integration

To integrate OpenTDF into your application:

1. **Choose Authentication Method**: Client credentials, bearer token, or custom auth
2. **Define Your Attributes**: Map your organizational roles and data classifications to attributes
3. **Create Subject Mappings**: Connect users/services to their entitlements
4. **Encrypt at Rest**: Protect files, documents, and data stores
5. **Encrypt in Transit**: Protect data shared between services
6. **Audit Access**: Monitor who accessed what data and when
