# Understanding OpenTDF

OpenTDF is a comprehensive platform for implementing **data-centric security** using **zero-trust principles**. This section explains the fundamental concepts that make OpenTDF unique and powerful for protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.

## Why OpenTDF Matters

In traditional security models, once data leaves a secure perimeter, control is often lost. OpenTDF changes this by:

- **Binding policy to data**: Access controls are cryptographically attached to data objects
- **Enabling zero-trust data**: Data remains protected regardless of where it travels
- **Providing granular control**: Fine-tuned access decisions based on context and attributes
- **Maintaining compliance**: Comprehensive audit trails and policy enforcement
