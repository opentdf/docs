## What is OpenTDF

OpenTDF is an open source system for implementing data centric security. It provides the basic services required to enable the definition, application, and enforcement of attribute based policies using the Zero Trust Data Format (ZTDF). ZTDF is an open standard that enables you to cryptographically bind attribute based access control (ABAC) policy to a data object so that the policy travels with the data wherever it goes.

OpenTDF builds upon a decade of experience at Virtru protecting data objects at scale using the Trusted Data Format for organizations of all sizes and across all industries.

<!-- Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
