# Managing the Platform

If you've already installed OpenTDF and need to start, stop, or restart the platform services, use these commands:

## Start the Platform

If Docker/Colima isn't running, start it first:

```shell
# For Colima users (macOS)
colima start

# For Docker Desktop users
# Start Docker Desktop from your Applications folder
```

Then start the OpenTDF platform:

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose up -d
```

Expected output:
```shell
 Container platform-opentdfdb-1 Running
 Container platform-keycloak-1 Started
 Container platform-platform-1 Started
 Container platform-caddy-1 Started
```

## Stop the Platform

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose down
```

Expected output:
```shell
 Container platform-platform-1 Stopped
 Container platform-keycloak-1 Stopped
 Container platform-caddy-1 Stopped
 Container platform-opentdfdb-1 Stopped
```

## Restart the Platform

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose restart
```

## Check Platform Status

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose ps
```

This shows all containers and their status (running, exited, etc.).

You can also verify the platform is healthy by visiting:
- https://platform.opentdf.local:8443/healthz (should show `{"status":"SERVING"}`)
- https://keycloak.opentdf.local:9443/ (should show "Resource not found")

## Troubleshooting

### TLS Certificate Verification

:::tip Canonical TLS Certificate Guide
This is the comprehensive guide for resolving all certificate/TLS issues across the platform, CLI, and SDKs. Both the [Quickstart](/quickstart#troubleshooting) and [SDK Troubleshooting](/sdks/troubleshooting) guides reference this section.
:::

If you encounter TLS certificate errors like "Failed to validate TLS certificates," "certificate signed by unknown authority," or browser "Not Secure" warnings, you have two options:

1. **Set environment variable** (recommended - works with profiles):
   ```shell
   export OTDFCTL_TLS_NO_VERIFY=true
   ```
   Then all subsequent `otdfctl` commands will skip certificate verification.

2. **Trust the SSL certificate**: The install script automatically imports the SSL certificate. If you started the platform manually or the automatic import failed, you can trust the certificate with these steps:

   1.  **Extract the root CA certificate:**
       ```shell
       cd ~/.opentdf/platform
       docker compose exec -T caddy cat /data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt > caddy-root.crt
       ```

   2.  **Add the certificate to your system's trust store:**
       -   **macOS:**
           ```shell
           sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain caddy-root.crt
           ```
       -   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
           ```shell
           sudo cp caddy-root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
           sudo update-ca-certificates
           ```
       -   **Windows:** Manually import `caddy-root.crt` into the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store using Certificate Manager (`certmgr.msc`).

**Important**: The `--tls-no-verify` flag doesn't work with profiles. Use the environment variable instead.
