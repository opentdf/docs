# Managing the Platform

If you've already installed OpenTDF and need to start, stop, or restart the platform services, use these commands:

## Start the Platform

If Docker/Colima isn't running, start it first:

```shell
# For Colima users (macOS)
colima start

# For Docker Desktop users
# Start Docker Desktop from your Applications folder
```

Then start the OpenTDF platform:

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose up -d
```

Expected output:
```shell
 Container platform-opentdfdb-1 Running
 Container platform-keycloak-1 Started
 Container platform-platform-1 Started
 Container platform-caddy-1 Started
```

## Stop the Platform

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose down
```

Expected output:
```shell
 Container platform-platform-1 Stopped
 Container platform-keycloak-1 Stopped
 Container platform-caddy-1 Stopped
 Container platform-opentdfdb-1 Stopped
```

## Restart the Platform

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose restart
```

## Check Platform Status

```shell
cd ~/.opentdf/platform
docker compose ps
```

This shows all containers and their status (running, exited, etc.).

You can also verify the platform is healthy by visiting:
- https://platform.opentdf.local:8443/healthz (should show `{"status":"SERVING"}`)
- https://keycloak.opentdf.local:9443/ (should show "Resource not found")

## Troubleshooting

### TLS Certificate Verification

If you encounter TLS certificate errors like "Failed to validate TLS certificates," you have two options:

1. **Set environment variable** (recommended - works with profiles):
   ```shell
   export OTDFCTL_TLS_NO_VERIFY=true
   ```
   Then all subsequent `otdfctl` commands will skip certificate verification.

2. **Trust the SSL certificate**: The install script automatically imports the SSL certificate. If you started the platform manually, you may need to trust the certificate in your system keychain or browser.

**Important**: The `--tls-no-verify` flag doesn't work with profiles. Use the environment variable instead.
