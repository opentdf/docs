## What is OpenTDF

OpenTDF is an open source system for implementing data centric security. It provides the basic services required to enable the definition, application, and enforcement of attribute based policies using the Zero Trust Data Format (ZTDF). ZTDF is an open standard that enables you to cryptographically bind attribute based access control (ABAC) policy to a data object so that the policy travels with the data wherever it goes.

OpenTDF builds upon a decade of experience at Virtru protecting data objects at scale using the Trusted Data Format for organizations of all sizes and across all industries.
