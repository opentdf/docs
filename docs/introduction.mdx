OpenTDF is an open source system for implementing data centric security. It provides the basic services required to enable the definition, application, and enforcement of attribute based policies using the Trust Data Format (TDF). TDF is an open standard that enables the cryptographic binding of attribute-based access control (ABAC) policy do a data object so that the policy travels with the data.
