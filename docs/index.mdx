        <p className="hero__subtitle">
          <strong>OpenTDF</strong> is an open source system for implementing data centric security. 
          It provides the basic services required to enable the definition, application, 
          and enforcement of attribute based policies using the Trust Data Format (TDF). 
          TDF is an open standard that enables you to cryptographically bind 
          attribute based access control (ABAC) policy to a data object so that 
          the policy travels with the data wherever it goes.
        </p>
        <p className="hero__subtitle">
          OpenTDF builds upon <strong>a decade of experience at Virtru</strong> 
          protecting data objects at scale using the Trusted Data Format 
          for organizations of all sizes and across all industries.

## Why Zero Trust and OpenTDF?

Today's cybersecurity landscape is increasingly adopting and requiring **Zero Trust models and frameworks**. Zero Trust operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify," ensuring that every access request is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted, regardless of its origin. 

**OpenTDF implements this model** by providing an open-source framework, specification, and set of services that prioritizes the protection and integrity of data at every stage. By integrating OpenTDF's data security features with a Zero Trust architecture, organizations can:

- **Enforce strict access controls** with attribute-based policies
- **Ensure data is continuously monitored** throughout its lifecycle
- **Maintain comprehensive visibility** into data interactions
- **Minimize the risk of data breaches** through cryptographic binding
- **Foster a secure environment** where data can be shared and utilized with confidence

Together, Zero Trust and OpenTDF empower businesses to uphold the highest standards of data security in an interconnected world.

## Project Overview and Current State

In 2023, the OpenTDF team undertook a **significant re-architecture** of the OpenTDF platform to enhance its extensibility and interoperability, responding to the evolving needs of our diverse user base and the dynamic cybersecurity landscape. See our [GitHub Organization Page](https://github.com/opentdf/) to navigate the new repositories.

This comprehensive overhaul involved:
- **Simplifying core service components** for better maintainability
- **Adopting standardized policy schemas** for interoperability  
- **Improving platform APIs and SDKs** in both developer experience and capability
- **Focusing on extensibility** to enable customization for specific use cases

Through the sponsorship of **Virtru** and its partners, the OpenTDF project has been meeting the needs of customers across industries and use cases. Check out [Virtru Data Security Platform](https://www.virtru.com/data-security-platform) for more.

## What Makes OpenTDF Different

- **Policy Travels with Data**: Unlike traditional access controls, TDF policies are cryptographically bound to the data itself
- **Zero-Trust by Design**: Data remains protected regardless of network boundaries or storage location  
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Attribute-based access control enables precise, contextual authorization decisions
- **Standards-Based**: Built on the proven NIST ABAC model for interoperability and compliance
- **Developer-Friendly**: SDKs for Go, Java, and JavaScript make integration straightforward
